VNE Code Refactoring / Improvement TODO list:

0. Make color an object property instead of current "random green" hack in the display function

0.5. Implement Vertex Normals (use openGL cross product function?)

1. Fix the ReSize() functions in vectors and matrices

2. See if there is a more intelligent way to use templates instead of
current vector format (maybe irrelevant since all vectors used are likely doubles)

3. Make class structure for movement instructions
   Then objects can have scripts attached to them
   
4. Fix those functions that take (dx, dy, dz) arguements to instead take CVector arguments (maybe).
   Assuming CVector does not leak memory... d'oh if it does.
