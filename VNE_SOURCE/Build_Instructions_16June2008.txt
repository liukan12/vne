Current State of Building: June 16 2008

There are three projects in vne.sln:

1. vne_engine; this guy builds a static library. any game / app using the engine needs to add
 "vne_engined.lib" or "vne_engine.lib" for debug and release versions of itself respectively.
 as a library it does not have a main function; the app using it will
 
 2. vne_mortar; this is a/the demo app. it includes the stuff from the engine. several
 of the files here are classes that inherit from base classes in the engine (ie a Mortar
 extends the PhysObject in the engine).
 
 3. vne_data; this is non-binary stuff like graphics, matlab scripts, etc
 
 
 To build you need to also make sure the SOIL library is correctly linked with; the projects
 should already be setup to do so, make sure they have libSOIL.lib in their additional
 dependecies and that the path to libSOIL.lib is in your VC projects libraries directory list.
 
 
 vne_build: this is a directory to put actual builds into when we are about to put them up
 as downloads.
 
 bin: this is where built stuff goes. When you compile, look for it to be located there.
 It is possible that it is not setup right for release mode build right now; do it in debug.
 You should see vne_mortard.exe and vne_engined.lib get built and put there.
