Ethan says:
	Use svn to upload or edit wiki pages. navigate to the wiki directory and do stuff there. I'm still getting used to svn, so i don't quite know how check out works
	but it should be self expanatory.  Save your files as *.wiki, also to link to a page use "[svn]" for the result: [svn]; where the svn is the file name of the wiki page!
