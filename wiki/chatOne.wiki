llama1917 (3:02:21 PM): ok so we agree on following specs
llama1917 (3:02:52 PM): 1. c++, visual studio (?), openGL, GLUT
llama1917 (3:03:14 PM): 2. There is a class along the lines of "World" that is a container for other things
llama1917 (3:03:33 PM): 3. The "World" has a (what did you call it?) List of Objects
llama1917 (3:03:47 PM): it also has other things but we won't worry about those for now
wilburthemexican (3:03:47 PM): yo
wilburthemexican (3:04:03 PM): i'm going to smoke a cig
wilburthemexican (3:04:12 PM): and then i can give this my full attention
llama1917 (3:04:16 PM): ok I'll list things and you come back and disagree / agree
wilburthemexican (3:04:27 PM): check out the google code project
wilburthemexican (3:04:31 PM): and see my wikis
llama1917 (3:04:34 PM): send me the link plz
llama1917 (3:04:37 PM): my PC crashed yesterday
llama1917 (3:04:43 PM): I am still reinstalling stuff
wilburthemexican (3:04:50 PM): code.google.com/p/vne
llama1917 (3:06:29 PM): ok I guess I'll try rapid SVN now to compare it with tortoiseSVN
llama1917 (3:07:04 PM): 4. At an initial implementation, an Object will have a derived class SimpleGeometric
llama1917 (3:07:23 PM): 5. The SimpleGeometric class will in turn have a derived class Sphere and/or Cube
llama1917 (3:07:57 PM): 6. All objects have at least a center coordinate for a member variable
llama1917 (3:08:40 PM): I'm not 100% sure about what information openGL needs to create a cube or sphere but whatever it is will be in one of those classes as member data
llama1917 (3:09:17 PM): also the "World" will contain a "Camera". This camera sets the projection view (where is the world being observed from?)
wilburthemexican (3:10:01 PM): sounds goo
wilburthemexican (3:10:03 PM): good
wilburthemexican (3:10:13 PM): p6 q6 47 86 r2 27 56 86 47 87 56 47 s2 16 77 s6 87 s2 q6 s6 36 r2 s6 27 47 37 96 46 r6 16 36 96 27 56 q6 16 r2 77 77 77 s2 s2 n3 07 47 47 86
wilburthemexican (3:10:32 PM): sorry
llama1917 (3:17:21 PM): 1100100110001010
llama1917 (3:17:30 PM): we should learn to communicate in hex or binary
llama1917 (3:18:05 PM): but what's more challenging is getting a computer to understand our language or world
wilburthemexican (3:18:12 PM): yeah
wilburthemexican (3:18:14 PM): ?
llama1917 (3:18:16 PM): hence the computer vision or comptuer pattern recognition
wilburthemexican (3:18:26 PM): that's the character code for the binary you just sent me
llama1917 (3:18:42 PM): lol
llama1917 (3:18:47 PM): so how about those 1-6 items
llama1917 (3:19:02 PM): i'm looking at your wiki now btw
wilburthemexican (3:19:15 PM): those are good items
llama1917 (3:19:36 PM): on the topic of your goal for python
wilburthemexican (3:19:49 PM): i think objects should have setSpeed(double velocity)
llama1917 (3:19:54 PM): I guess python would have to tell objects "go here. do this. then do that."
llama1917 (3:20:02 PM): well, more formally
llama1917 (3:20:14 PM): objects need to have a state variable with 12 degrees of freedom
llama1917 (3:20:18 PM): erg
llama1917 (3:20:22 PM): 9 I guess
llama1917 (3:20:27 PM): 3 for position
llama1917 (3:20:36 PM): 3 for x,y,z velocity
llama1917 (3:20:42 PM): 3 for i,j,k angular velocity
wilburthemexican (3:21:01 PM): well it would be cool to have all that worked out internally
wilburthemexican (3:21:11 PM): so you just give it a direction and speed
wilburthemexican (3:21:18 PM): and then it figures out the rest
wilburthemexican (3:21:38 PM): but how do you represent direction in 3 axises
llama1917 (3:21:46 PM): [x,y,z] direction
llama1917 (3:21:58 PM): to go from point A to point B you are moving in the B - A direction
wilburthemexican (3:22:46 PM): 90 degrees on the x,z plane, 60 degrees on xy plane?
llama1917 (3:22:50 PM): yeah
wilburthemexican (3:22:54 PM): does that make any sense
llama1917 (3:22:54 PM): rotate about an axis
llama1917 (3:23:12 PM): oh for the direction
wilburthemexican (3:23:33 PM): so what direction needs 3 angles
llama1917 (3:23:33 PM): no to set a direction you need to use [x,y,z] - [x0,y0,z0] = [dir_x, dir_y, dir_z]
wilburthemexican (3:23:45 PM): oh ok
llama1917 (3:24:04 PM): but yeah you can specify a direction with polar coordinates with 2 variables
llama1917 (3:24:16 PM): I don't think we'd want to do that though, it would get confusing
wilburthemexican (3:24:23 PM): right
llama1917 (3:24:47 PM): but as far as velocity goes
llama1917 (3:24:49 PM): that means
llama1917 (3:24:55 PM): the world also needs a global definition of time
wilburthemexican (3:25:02 PM): right
wilburthemexican (3:25:22 PM): it should be some variable like frames_per_second
llama1917 (3:25:38 PM): well you can use an actual timer
llama1917 (3:25:42 PM): uses your CPU timer
wilburthemexican (3:25:42 PM): and then we need some timer object to figure
wilburthemexican (3:25:50 PM): right
wilburthemexican (3:26:05 PM): yeah we can have a timer to figure velocity out
wilburthemexican (3:26:17 PM): then fps will be independent but based off that timer
wilburthemexican (3:26:31 PM): so all things have the same velocity no matter the computer
llama1917 (3:26:49 PM): is it possible just have it move 1.0 step per velocity amount  each iteration for the velocity"
llama1917 (3:27:10 PM): right, to have it have time independent of computer speed you have to use a timer
llama1917 (3:27:35 PM): if we don't care that it slows down on a slow computer or complex scene that takes forever to draw, we could just define velocity of 1.0 to mean move 1.0 in coordinates per iteration of drawing
wilburthemexican (3:27:53 PM): i don't think we want to do that
wilburthemexican (3:28:13 PM): i think we need a timer that determines all movement realistically
llama1917 (3:28:13 PM): yeah
wilburthemexican (3:28:34 PM): so even if it draws twice a second it still moves 20ft a second
llama1917 (3:28:40 PM): yeah
wilburthemexican (3:28:49 PM): so we need some sort of coordinate space system for the world
wilburthemexican (3:29:00 PM): that could be defined in meters or something
llama1917 (3:29:00 PM): well that is in OpenGL I think
llama1917 (3:29:20 PM): there are "world coordinates" that everything is defined in
wilburthemexican (3:29:23 PM): ok well if openGl has that then we should use it
llama1917 (3:29:25 PM): then you plop a camera down
llama1917 (3:29:38 PM): OpenGL then determines the "pixel coordinates" and draws it
llama1917 (3:29:50 PM): but all the math we do should be in x,y,z floating point coordinates
wilburthemexican (3:29:56 PM): right
llama1917 (3:30:34 PM): hey you want to see a video demo of something I'm working on now?
wilburthemexican (3:30:40 PM): yeah
wilburthemexican (3:30:51 PM): do you know how to use uml modeling
wilburthemexican (3:31:04 PM): dia is a great program for diagrams
llama1917 (3:31:32 PM): UML: I've used in briefly, but yeah we should probably use it
llama1917 (3:31:39 PM): dia eh
llama1917 (3:31:53 PM): do you use UML for your class projects?
wilburthemexican (3:32:19 PM): no, but they are in some of the books i have, so i've learned how to use it a little
llama1917 (3:32:20 PM): the only complicating factor is we need to design the classes to efficiently use OpenGL, not like starting from scratch in a java program
wilburthemexican (3:32:30 PM): true
llama1917 (3:32:54 PM): we should really just get those basic 1-6 implemented before doing a more complex design
ATTENTION (3:32:59 PM): Transfer complete: pkevolve.avi.
llama1917 (3:33:03 PM): so that file
wilburthemexican (3:33:06 PM): http://live.gnome.org/Dia
llama1917 (3:33:12 PM): starts with an initial contour on a triangulated surface
llama1917 (3:33:19 PM): then it evolves to capture a region of maximal curvature
llama1917 (3:33:32 PM): it seems maybe "stupid" because it is so easy for us to do visually
llama1917 (3:34:00 PM): but, how would you do it on a computer? try all possible closed curves? there are more than 10^15 such curves to try
wilburthemexican (3:34:17 PM): hey
wilburthemexican (3:34:31 PM): it is not a codec my computer recognizes
llama1917 (3:34:51 PM): really
llama1917 (3:35:00 PM): ok let me send you a couple frames then
wilburthemexican (3:35:38 PM): what codec is it
wilburthemexican (3:35:47 PM): what are you using to play it on you pc
llama1917 (3:35:50 PM): not sure, but its an AVI file that matlab created
llama1917 (3:35:54 PM): windows meida player
llama1917 (3:35:57 PM): 9
ATTENTION (3:36:10 PM): Transfer complete: evolve160.zip.
wilburthemexican (3:37:03 PM): so what is that
llama1917 (3:37:23 PM): so the project is aimed at picking out parts of a brain for robotic surgery
llama1917 (3:37:31 PM): this surface is a fake thing that kind of looks like a brain
llama1917 (3:37:39 PM): I'm about to run it on a real brain over the weekend
wilburthemexican (3:37:44 PM): lol
wilburthemexican (3:37:52 PM): i'll try it out
wilburthemexican (3:38:05 PM): just hook it up to my head, i'm sure your math is right
llama1917 (3:38:10 PM): lol, well real brain image I mean
llama1917 (3:38:14 PM): not a patient or anything
wilburthemexican (3:38:18 PM): oh ok
wilburthemexican (3:38:30 PM): does the image need to be a 3d model
llama1917 (3:38:35 PM): yeah
wilburthemexican (3:38:42 PM): got it
llama1917 (3:38:43 PM): well the 3d model is built from a bunch of 2d images
wilburthemexican (3:38:46 PM): oh
llama1917 (3:39:00 PM): once you have the 3d model, you click a couple initialization points then it segments a folded region
llama1917 (3:40:03 PM): ok but I need to work on a HW in a minute
llama1917 (3:40:08 PM): so here is hte plan of action
wilburthemexican (3:40:23 PM): ok what is it
llama1917 (3:40:23 PM): you: get visual studio and / or another c++ tool that you are OK with
wilburthemexican (3:40:30 PM): right
llama1917 (3:40:33 PM): visual studio has the benefit of having the open GL libraries
llama1917 (3:40:39 PM): maybe some other IDE does too
wilburthemexican (3:40:40 PM): i'll get that then
llama1917 (3:40:59 PM): I'll initialize the project in visual studio to get a feel for how it fits together
llama1917 (3:41:06 PM): I need to also build a debug library of GLUT
llama1917 (3:41:14 PM): the one now I have is the release build .DLL
wilburthemexican (3:41:14 PM): i'll fool around with that sample you sent me
llama1917 (3:41:31 PM): but, maybe you should work on some higher level UML
llama1917 (3:41:47 PM): read up on how openGL draws things on a higher level, so the design work you do correlates to have it should function
llama1917 (3:42:07 PM): ie you should be thinking in x,y,z coordinates, not worrything about  512 pixels down and 384 to the right
wilburthemexican (3:42:13 PM): right
wilburthemexican (3:42:33 PM): i'll work on some uml and try to program some simple opengl stuff
llama1917 (3:42:41 PM): ok, sounds like a plan
llama1917 (3:42:49 PM): let me take a break and do some HW.. due at midnight
llama1917 (3:42:51 PM): on friday
llama1917 (3:42:53 PM): on a nice day
llama1917 (3:42:53 PM): gah
llama1917 (3:43:13 PM): talk to you over the weekend or early next week about this. later
wilburthemexican (3:43:19 PM): yeah sounds good
wilburthemexican (3:43:21 PM): later
llama1917 (3:43:23 PM): wait
llama1917 (3:43:25 PM): post this on the wiki
llama1917 (3:43:29 PM): or the important parts
llama1917 (3:43:37 PM): ok later
